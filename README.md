**PayFlow-Salary Management System**

PayFlow is a web-based application built with the goal of improving transparency and trust in 
organizational payroll processes. While many existing systems focus on automating complex salary 
calculations and tax handling, this system takes a different approach. It emphasizes visibility and 
accountability by providing employees secure access to their personal and salary-related records in a 
clear and consistent manner.
The system is developed using a Blazor web interface, backed by a SQL Server Express database, and 
follows a three-tier architecture. It is modular, user-friendly, and aims to foster a culture of openness 
and integrity in salary management.
